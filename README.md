Gustave: a User-oriented Statistical Toolkit for Analytical Variance
Estimation

Gustave provides a toolkit for analytical variance estimation in survey sampling. Apart from the implementation of standard variance estimators (Sen-Yates-Grundy, Deville-Till√©), its main feature is to help the methodologist produce easy-to-use variance estimation "wrappers", where systematic operations (linearization, domain estimation) are handled in a consistent and transparent way for the end user.
